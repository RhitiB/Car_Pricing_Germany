# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)

This machine learning project estimates the **resale price of used cars in Germany** using K-Nearest Neighbors Regression. The app takes four inputs from the user and predicts the price using a trained scikit-learn model â€” all served via a **Streamlit web app**.

## ðŸ“Š Features Used for Prediction

- `year`: Year of manufacture of the car
- `power_ps`: Engine power in PS (metric horsepower)
- `fuel_consumption_g_km`: Fuel consumption in grams per kilometre
- `mileage_in_km`: Total mileage driven (in kilometres)

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Germany Used Cars Dataset 2023 available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wspirat/germany-used-cars-dataset-2023).
After downloading, the files were renamed as follows:

- cars_dataset.csv (original dataset)
- cars_dataset_cleaned.csv (dataset after data cleaning)

## Model Training Notes

- The dataset was cleaned, analyzed, and transformed using multiple Jupyter Notebooks.
- A K-Nearest Neighbors model was trained on scaled inputs using StandardScaler.
- The best k was chosen through experimentation (k=5).
- The trained model and scaler were saved using Python's pickle module.
